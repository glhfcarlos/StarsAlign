# StarsAlign

<p>Stars Align is a 2D top-down game where two female lovers struggle with their relationship, they are constantly arguing and bickering and are having conflicts with each other. They hope that planning a camping trip will solve all their problems. However, upon arriving at the camping spot, they realize their issues persist. One of the lovers asks the other to gather wood for the fire, but due to their strained relationship, there is no communication. Consequently, one of them angrily leaves and becomes lost. Now, their mission is to find each other. This game will explore one perspective of the lover traveling to find the other one. In order to do so, the player must traverse a forest containing 2 mini-games, each representing elements of a relationship. The first mini-game encapsulates the concept of active listening by playing a musical memory game, and the second one represents balance in a relationship which is played as a star-balancing game.</p>
